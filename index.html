        <h1>My European Cruise</h1>
        <p>One of the best trips I have ever taken was the eight day Carnival Mediterranean Cruise. The people, food and over all culture was amazing. Click on the links below to experience some of the trip through my eyes.</p>

            <h2>BARCELONA</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, my wife and I didn't get to see much of Barcelona because it just happens that on the day we arrived the Barcelona airport employees were on strike. The airport was a ghost town even though it was packed with flight passagers arriving from around the world, which almost caused us to miss our cruiseship.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="MARSEILLE"></a>
            <h2>MARSEILLE (PROVENCE)</h2>
            <p>Interesting enough I couldn't find any of the images for this location. So lets pretend I put some really awesome pictures here.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="LIVORNO"></a>
            <h2>LIVORNO (FLORENCE & PISA)</h2>
            <p>Florence and Pisa were so beautiful. All the photos taken looked like they were photoshopped eventhough they are real.</p>

            <a name="ROME"></a>
            <h2>ROME (CIVITAVECCHIA)</h2>
            <p>The Colosseum was by far one of my favorite places. It's just something you have to see for youself, it's mindblowing.</p>

        <section>
            <a name="NAPLES"></a>
            <h2>NAPLES (CAPRI & POMPEII)</h2>
            <p>Capri was another beautiful location, great place to take a bucnch of photos.</p>
            <p>However, Pompeii is like nothing you've ever seen. It's so erie, and quite. Before arriving to Pompeii they played the movie on the ship (you know, the one with Kit Harrington) which made the experience so much better. </p>

        <section>
            <a name="PALMA"></a>
            <h2>PALMA DE MALLORCA</h2>
            <p>Lastly, there was Palma de Mallorca. By the time we arrived to this location we couldn't walk anymore so we decided to take a photo from the ship just to document we visited.</p>
